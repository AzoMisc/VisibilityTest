# VisibilityTest

This is a test repo for manipulating the visible commit history to produce an interactive visual - e.g. writing today's date inside the commit graph.

## Goals

The goals for this repo are:

* Using the GitHub REST API
* Determining how the commit graph can be controlled remotely using the API
    * Meaning, how easily can a repo be hidden via privacy
    * How long do these changes take to be visible.
